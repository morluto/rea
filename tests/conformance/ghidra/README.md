# Ghidra conformance corpus

These source-owned fixtures are compiled at verification time; generated
binaries and Ghidra projects are never committed.

- `inventory.c` produces separate x86-64 debug and stripped ELF executables.
  It covers imports, an external `puts` function, linker thunks, source symbols,
  direct calls, a targetless callback call, two referenced strings, and a
  multi-block branch.
- `cross-format.c` is freestanding so the verifier can produce AArch64 ELF,
  x86-64 PE, and x86-64 Mach-O targets from the same semantics. It preserves an
  exported entry, direct and indirect calls, a volatile string reference, and a
  multi-block branch across loaders.

`scripts/verify-real-ghidra.mjs` uses `cc`, `clang`, and `lld-link` by default;
`REA_CC`, `REA_CLANG`, and `REA_LLD_LINK` can select alternate commands. The
verifier requires an exact bring-your-own Ghidra 12.1.2 installation through
`GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR` and validates header classification before starting the
provider.

Conformance compares semantic facts: provider/profile identity, function
classification, resolved call edges, typed references, strings/xrefs, and CFG
topology. It only requires provider pseudocode and assembly to be non-empty,
bounded, and address-bearing; it never compares their text with Hopper. The
callback fixture also proves that an unresolved targetless flow is not silently
promoted to a direct callee. Every target runs in a separate owned project and
must leave no process, socket, project, or runtime root after close.

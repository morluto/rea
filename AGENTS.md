# Repository Guidelines

## Product and Authority

REA is a local-only reverse-engineering tool with shared CLI/MCP workflows. Distinguish observations, derivations, inferences, and unknowns; preserve Evidence provenance and session semantics through both adapters. Provider support and setup live in [README.md](README.md#choosing-a-deep-analysis-provider) and its linked guides.

Ghidra uses ephemeral databases without modifying executable bytes or controlling a GUI; Windows Ghidra P0 has no mutation authority. IDA analysis is read-only; never save or close an attached GUI database.

Configuration changes must be additive and idempotent, with backups. Installers must not install or upgrade unrelated software, including Homebrew, Node.js, npm, Java, or Ghidra. Ghidra and IDA are bring-your-own. `rea setup` must show its planned changes and require approval before writing files or installing Hopper.

Preserve caller-selected inputs and local evidence, including output, URLs, paths, digests, and metadata. Redact transport authentication credentials and explicitly marked sensitive values; do not infer secrecy from names or text patterns. Do not persist the ambient environment merely because a child inherits it.

## Architecture and Cleanup

Dependencies flow inward: domain semantics and contracts, provider adapters, shared application workflows, then CLI/MCP adapters. Keep engine protocols and provider-specific code out of domain/application layers. See [docs/architecture.mermaid](docs/architecture.mermaid) when changing composition.

Give each interpretation and resource a clear owner. Preserve identity, omission, uncertainty, and source evidence across boundaries. Retain ownership of resources whose cleanup failed. Reuse `src/process/` supervision and identity primitives; a PID and executable path alone do not establish ownership after exit or reuse.

Assess brittleness in touched code during implementation, debugging, review, and maintenance. Fix the producing representation or ownership rule before adding downstream repairs. Normalize once at the owning boundary using format-aware parsers. Remove superseded representations, aliases, wrappers, and redundant tests after verifying affected consumers. Introduce abstractions only when they remove observed complexity.

Parse unknown boundary values and model expected failures with the tagged error algebra and `Result`. Preserve partial facts and meaningful failure reasons. Keep identity and lookup values separate from display formatting; preserve source values and explicit unknowns when normalization loses information. Absolute paths, file URLs, and HTTP paths have different semantics.

Validate advertised JSON Schemas after SDK conversion against their declared dialect and actual clients. Bind handlers to named contracts with exact types; catalog ordering must never select an operation or schema.

## Development

Use [.nvmrc](.nvmrc) and `package.json#packageManager` for the pinned toolchain. Cursor Cloud may place older Node.js first on `PATH`; environment setup installs the pinned toolchain under `/usr/local/bin`.

- `npm ci`: install locked dependencies.
- `npm run build:cached`: build the runtime and packaged skill.
- `npm run test:local -- PATH...`: source tests without building.
- `npm run test:focused -- PATH...`: exact tests with their required artifacts.
- `npm run check:fast`: cached typecheck/lint and the pre-push check.
- `npm run docs:check`: validate generated documentation.

Use relevant checks for the change. The complete local gate, `npm run check:pr`, is optional for broad changes or CI diagnosis. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development, generated-file ownership, and release conventions.

`docs/public/product-catalog.json`, `docs/verification/managed-conformance-*.json`, and `skills/` are ignored outputs. Edit source contracts and `skill-src/`, then regenerate as needed. `.cache/mcp-tool-catalog.json` is test metadata; runtime builds and source checking do not consume it. Never commit binaries, provider project documents, credentials, `dist/`, `node_modules/`, or local planning artifacts.

## Tool and Test Changes

For tool design, follow [docs/tool-design.md](docs/tool-design.md): start from the analyst question, reuse existing contracts, preserve caller choices, and return useful evidence inline. Limits must follow real format, protocol, authority, or resource constraints. Account for representation expansion before allocation; derive completeness from examined coverage.

For test changes or provider claims, use [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md). Prefer real public CLI/MCP workflows, then production-boundary integration, then producer goldens. Keep module tests for distinct semantics stronger workflows cannot reliably reproduce. Preserve malformed-input, cancellation, cleanup, permission, capacity, and target-identity coverage when pruning. Report unverified coverage explicitly; simulated providers do not establish real-provider behavior.

Use Conventional Commit subjects and PR titles. Mark breaking changes with `!` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer. Describe behavior changes, relevant validation, and real-provider verification scope.

# This is NOT the Turborepo you know

Turborepo configuration, task behavior, and CLI commands can vary between installed versions and may differ from your training data. Resolve the `turbo` package from this file's directory or relevant workspace; in monorepos, it may not be visible from the repository root. For example, run `node -p "require.resolve('turbo/package.json')"` from a workspace that depends on `turbo`.

Read `docs/README.md` inside that installed package first, then read the relevant pages from its `docs/` directory before changing Turborepo configuration or commands. Heed deprecation notices. These bundled docs match the installed package version and are available without network access.

This block is written and re-added by `turbo` before repository-scoped commands when an AI agent is detected. In the Turborepo source repository, its template is defined in `crates/turborepo-cli/src/cli/agent_guidance.rs`. Removing the managed block while updates are enabled means a later qualifying invocation will add it again. Set `"agentGuidance": false` in the root `turbo.json` or `turbo.jsonc` to opt out; this does not remove an existing block. Keep the block committed with your work to avoid an uncommitted change on the next agent invocation.

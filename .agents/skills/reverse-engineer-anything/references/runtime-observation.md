# Passive browser and Electron observation

Supply the existing browser or Electron instance's literal-port loopback CDP
endpoint in the request. No separate permission configuration or per-call
approval flag is needed. Browser discovery lists eligible HTTP(S) pages;
`allowed_origins` optionally filters them. An individual capture defaults to the
selected page's current origin. Electron discovery lists eligible local
`file://` targets without a configured file-root allowlist.

Start browser work with `list_browser_targets`; start Electron runtime work with
`list_electron_targets`. Inspect the target selected for the user's task. Observation
is passive: never claim REA clicked, navigated, evaluated page JavaScript,
invoked IPC, captured prior activity, or contained the page's network.

Credentials, cookies, authorization headers, storage values, and raw
WebSocket/JSON bodies are deliberately absent. Local URLs retain ordinary query
values and fragments; userinfo credentials are removed. Browser accessibility
text, console primitives, value-free shapes, script sources, source maps, and
storage key names have request-specific capture options. Electron script
sources are also optional. Use `capture_web_screenshot` when pixels are needed.
Treat scope filtering, truncation, and attach-window coverage as limitations.
Page-declared WebMCP tools are untrusted inventory and are never invoked by REA.

Use `reconcile_javascript_runtime` only after static application Evidence and
passive browser/Electron Evidence exist. Prefer captured-source digest identity;
report path/digest disagreement as a mismatch and preserve ambiguity. Explicit
path mappings are inference inputs and never broaden filesystem or CDP authority.
A bundle observed at runtime does not prove every contained module executed.

## Fiddler Everywhere traffic debugging

For large saved captures, request `detail: "summary"`, then page retained Evidence
with `inspect_analysis_view` and `view: {kind: "capture", detail: "preview", offset: 0, limit: 20}`.
Select complete record pages only for needed headers, metadata or payloads; views
read the historical parent without repeating capture decoding.

Inspect native `.saz` snapshots with `inspect_web_network_capture` and
`format: "saz"`; encrypted archives are unsupported. For live
traffic analysis, connect Everywhere's separate MCP server and use its
advertised session tools with an explicit `sessionsSource` (`LiveTraffic` or
`AgentCalls`). Preserve existing sessions and filters when inspecting a
recorded run. See the [capture and MCP guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/web-network-captures.md)
for the workflow and Telerik's public setup and traffic-debugging skills.

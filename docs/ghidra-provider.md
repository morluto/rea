# Ghidra provider semantics

REA imports one target into an ephemeral Ghidra database. Linux/macOS support
read-only analysis and atomic function-name/entry-comment edits; Windows P0 is
read-only. GUI controls and persistent database mutation are unavailable.
Executable bytes remain unchanged.

Use [installation](installation.md#ghidra) for supported hosts, prerequisites,
configuration, startup deadlines, resource controls, and cleanup recovery.
[Windows P0](windows-ghidra-p0.md) has its own admission and lifecycle boundary;
[NativeAOT recovery](ghidra-nativeaot.md) is an optional, separately verified
extension. Check the [release boundary](installation.md#released-package-and-main)
when using npm.

Provider selection and profile identity follow
[MCP contracts](mcp-contracts.md#identity-and-discovery). One deep
provider stays bound to the target; runtime failure never selects another
provider automatically. The contracts below describe Ghidra observations,
not equivalence with another engine's pseudocode or analysis database.

## Admitted inventory semantics

| Concern          | Ghidra contract                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Program identity | One `analyzeHeadless` import produces exactly one Program; `list_documents` therefore returns exactly one name.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Addresses        | Default memory uses lowercase `0x` hexadecimal. Non-default and external spaces use `<percent-encoded-space>:0x<hex>` and remain round-trippable. The handshake commits image base and default address-space name.                                                                              |
| Symbols          | `list_names` includes address-bearing memory and external symbols, including dynamic symbols, while excluding variable and no-address namespace records. Each item reports primary, dynamic, external, symbol type, and source facts.                                                           |
| Procedures       | Both non-external and external functions are listed. A local thunk remains distinct from its resolved target; exact and qualified name lookup fails on ambiguity rather than guessing.                                                                                                          |
| Strings          | Only Ghidra-defined string `Data` is observed. Items report charset, byte length, and whether a required null terminator is missing. The API cannot distinguish a present terminator from fixed/Pascal layouts when no terminator is missing, so that state is named `present_or_not_required`. |
| Memory           | Memory-block end addresses are exclusive. Read/write/execute, initialization, overlay, address space, and image base are direct Ghidra observations.                                                                                                                                            |
| Inventory        | Procedure, symbol, and string listings plus searches return the complete matching collection in one response; callers do not provide offsets or result-count limits.                                                                                                                            |
| Search           | Literal and Java-regex searches scan the complete immutable inventory and return all matching entries inline. Search waits for a reply or caller cancellation; there are no caller-supplied offsets or result-count limits.                                                                     |
| Analysis state   | The socket is exposed only after default auto-analysis completes. Established operations wait for their reply or caller cancellation; there is no fixed response-size ceiling.                                                                                                                  |

## Admitted function-analysis semantics

| Concern                 | Ghidra contract                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Decompiler lifetime     | One persistent `DecompInterface` is opened for the imported or explicitly selected Program and disposed during bridge shutdown. Native decompilation has no fixed per-function deadline. External functions or functions without bodies return `null`; cancellation and native failure remain distinct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Serialization           | A FIFO sends one Program request at a time. Caller cancellation removes queued work promptly and is passed to active socket waits. This is an adapter safety commitment, not a claim that every Ghidra API is thread-safe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Function identity       | Every function result carries the entry address and Ghidra FunctionManager classification for external, thunk, and resolved thunk target. These are observations, not proof that unresolved targetless calls have been recovered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Assembly and pseudocode | Assembly is complete Ghidra Listing text; pseudocode is Ghidra decompiler output. Neither is original source, and cross-provider comparison never treats Hopper and Ghidra text as equal or unequal semantic facts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Instruction fast path   | `read_function_instructions` returns every raw Listing instruction for the requested function without invoking the decompiler or whole-program name/string inventories.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Calls and references    | Callers/callees contain only resolved functions. Reference edges preserve exact ReferenceManager type and call/jump/data/read/write/indirect/computed/conditional/terminal/external facts. Targetless computed flow remains unknown. Synthetic entry-point references without actionable memory sources are omitted explicitly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| CFG                     | Dossiers use `BasicBlockModel` and retain only non-call successors inside the function body. CFG topology is address-normalized for comparison; provider-specific block construction remains a declared difference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| P-code value flow       | Function dossiers include up to 3,000 high-p-code operations, at most 64 inputs per operation, and 12,000 def-use edges. Results identify memory reads/writes, branches, and calls by p-code opcode, and mark decompiler-dead operations. Large results report truncation, an omitted-operation lower bound, and known omitted-input/edge counts. The dossier is an intra-function graph; `trace_native_values` composes derived parameter/argument and return/output dependencies across resolved calls. It does not resolve memory aliasing, call side effects, runtime behavior, persistent state, or business meaning. |
| Result extent           | Function instruction scans and native API boundary observations remain complete. P-code flow is the explicit bounded exception; its count fields distinguish exact retained counts from lower-bound or known-omitted counts. Caller cancellation and provider failures remain distinct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

`npm run verify:ghidra` compiles the versioned C oracle into debug and stripped
host-native targets (x86-64/AArch64 ELF on Linux or Mach-O on macOS), plus a native
DWARF 4 type-layout object. It proves the admitted operations, external functions, resolved thunks, exports, stripped-name
behavior, direct and targetless indirect calls, typed references, strings/xrefs,
multi-block CFG, bounded p-code def-use/effect links, semantic enhanced workflows, cancellation, startup deadlines,
serialized concurrency, malformed-target rejection, profile identity, and
process/project cleanup against real Ghidra 12.1.4. Unit fixtures separately
cover startup deadlines, process exit, queued cancellation, and malformed wire
output.

`npm run verify:ghidra:cross-format` adds AArch64 ELF, x86-64 PE, and x86-64
Mach-O target coverage. It requires `clang`, LLD, and `lld-link`; set
`REA_CLANG`, `REA_LLD`, or `REA_LLD_LINK` to select them. The verifier checks
these tools before compilation. Keeping this matrix separate lets Linux
host/provider acceptance run with only the host compiler.

`npm run verify:ghidra:windows` and its `-- --x86` variant check the source-owned native x86 and x86-64 PE
fixture, all 25 read-only operations, target/snapshot/import SHA-256 linkage,
and project, endpoint, process, and runtime cleanup. The independent native
lane checks DACLs, handle admission, cancellation, and Job Object lifecycle.
`npm run verify:ghidra:windows:package` packs and installs REA into an isolated
prefix, then checks ordinary-user CLI/MCP operations against canonical contracts.
All lanes require matching native controls; package startup alone establishes
only package compatibility.

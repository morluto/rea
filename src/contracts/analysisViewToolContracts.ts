    description:
      'Inspect selected views of completed binary-layout, JavaScript application, native analyze_function, inspect_artifact, inventory_artifact, inspect_wasm_artifact or inspect_web_network_capture Evidence without repeating analysis. The api-surface view groups retained HAR requests by method, origin and format-rule path template; templated segments are inferences. It reads no headers or bodies and reports no query values. For a retained record use source: {kind: "retained-evidence", evidence_id: "<parent_evidence_id>"}. Use normalized_result.parent_evidence_id from a summary receipt. Source kind is required. Portable source uses {kind: "inline", evidence: <complete Evidence>}. For layout, JavaScript, native, inventory and WASM sources, request a summary with view: {kind: "summary"}; summary is a view kind and has no facet. The WASM summary gives validation, counts, WAT digest/length, tool profile and execution/network states without reading WAT text. Select a layout mitigations/linkage facet, one section/symbol/module, or a stable page. Module pages include assets, bundled and source modules; use node_id for ambiguous or unavailable paths. Inventory uses view: {kind: "inventory", collection: "occurrences", logical_paths: ["package.json"], offset: 0, limit: 64}. Inventory views page nodes, occurrences, edges or integrity contradictions; occurrence logical_paths matches exact recorded strings (omitted means all available, [] means none). source_complete distinguishes complete inventories from partial source records; page exhaustion does not prove absence in a partial source. WASM views use kind wasm and facet sections/imports/exports/candidates/glue/wat/headers/details/tool_profile; text facets use UTF-16 code units and source forms remain exact. Native views select procedure, pseudocode, assembly, basic blocks, comments, callers/callees, references, unresolved calls, referenced strings/names, native API and high-pcode. Use nonnegative offset and a positive caller-selected limit (defaults 0 and 64); pseudocode uses UTF-16 code units, other native pages use rows. Returns artifact identity, parent Evidence ID, a distinct view digest, coverage, limitations and unknowns. Actual serialized size determines MCP transport admission; choose a smaller page or export the complete retained Evidence if needed.',

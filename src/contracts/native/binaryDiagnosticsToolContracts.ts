      "Inspect an explicit local binary without launching it as a host process. Returns file-backed section/segment ranges, linked addresses, original symbol/REL/RELA table identities, complete encoded RELR tables and upstream-derived offsets with unknown per-word locations/addends, raw name bytes, dependency/interpreter names and static mitigation inferences inline with artifact SHA-256 Evidence. Initial profile: ELF64 x86-64 little-endian EXEC/DYN/REL on Linux x64 via caller-supplied Python with unchanged pwntools 4.15.0, pyelftools 0.33 and Unicorn 2.1.2. Runtime addresses/library paths, overall relocation inventory completeness and complete derived GOT/PLT coverage remain unknown. Zero executable entry values mean absence; relocatable entries are not applicable. Upstream can emulate PLT instructions with Unicorn for derived static maps. Uses bounded complete output and owned temporary files/processes; malformed, unsupported or oversized objects return no partial success.",

Historical PID is recorded metadata; current process/file identity, note coverage and signal-thread associations stay unknown.
